Dice rolls are in the usual format:[number of dice]d[sides on dice]

The highest and lowest dice can be removed by adding 't' or 'b' to the end, respectively, along with the amount to be removed:
#d#t[number of dice to be removed from top]
#d#b[number of dice to be removed from bottom]

Multiple dice can be rolled at the same time:
#d# #d#

Basic math is supported, as well as the following functions:
abs, min, max, sqrt, sin, cos, tan

Some common operations have shortcuts
1d20: T
Advantage (2d20b1): A
Disadvantage (2d20t1): D
Stats Rolling (4d6b1): S

Everything is case insensitive

Type 'exit' to quit
